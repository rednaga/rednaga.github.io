# RedNaga Blog

## Installing

You need to install the hexo-cli globally and also install all the required node modules:

```
npm install hexo-cli -g
npm i --no-optional
```

That's it.

## Overview

Write articles and save to [source/_posts](source/_posts). Filename should be `YYYY-DD-MM-your-title.md` as this'll help keep things organized.

Stuff you're working on but are unfinished with can go in [source/_drafts](source/_drafts). If the repo is public, they'll be public, so, you know, watch out.

All of the "behind the scenes" stuff that you'll be working on is in the `blog` branch. The `master` branch contains the static site generated by Hexo. Be sure to `git checkout blog` if you want to do any work.

You can preview your changes while working on them with:

```
hexo serve
```

## Deploying

Write mind-blowing blog post and commit it to the repo normally. For example:

```
git add source/_posts
git commit
```

Then clean and deploy:
```
hexo clean
hexo deploy
```

The clean step isn't technically required, but I always have trouble with weird stuff not updating unless I clean first.
